    <p>
    Nobu is a program built by students, for students. Originally worked on at HackRU2014, Nobu is the ideal site for changing your essays with           ease. The creators, Liam Rahav, Sarah Nathanson, Sumin Kim, and Nicholas Kassoy, are students at Bergen County Academies as members of the Academy for Technology and Computer Science. We want to create something that can be used for people just like us, who need some help with an essay but have no where to turn. The inspiration for the name came from its Japanese meaning, "to prolong or stretch."

    Simply upload your text from Google Drive, or copy it directly in. With the option to shorten your essay into a more concise version of the subject material, it takes the work out of consistant stops to a thesaurus or grammar site. No more do you have to worry about going over your assignment's 500 word limit- Nobu can take this into account and shorten it for you. However, if you're feeling like you just haven't written enough, Nobu can expand upon your essay to use words with more characters, better language, and a more impressive writing style. Worried about what Nobu is going to change for you? All changes are highlighted and can be reverted back to the original as needed.
